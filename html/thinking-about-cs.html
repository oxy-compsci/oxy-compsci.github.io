        Thinking about CS?

    <p>
        This page provides an introduction to the Computer Science program and information on how to get started.
    </p>
    <p>
        Computer science is a broad field—one that encompasses everything from digital logic and advanced mathematical theory to video games and data science. These foundations and applications all require fundamental knowledge of how a computer works as well as the ability to translate processes into working programs.
    </p>
    <p>
        In keeping with the liberal arts tradition, the computer science major at Oxy gives you the flexibility to combine your computer science studies with your other academic interests while also providing you with the core skills and knowledge you need to pursue advanced studies or start a career in the field.

        To complete the Computer Science major, students must take an additional six courses on top of the required core coursework. These six additional courses will vary depending on which of the following three pathways through the major the student selects. If you’re interested in the Computer Science major, you should meet with an advisor early on to explore these pathways:

            How to Get Started

    <p>
        If you’re new to computer science, the first step in learning more about the major is to take
        <a href="http://oxy.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2017-2018/Catalog/Courses/COMP-Computer-Science/100/COMP-131">
            COMP 131: Fundamentals of Computer Science
        </a>
        . This course is meant for beginners and assumes you have no prior programming experience. In COMP 131 you will learn to think computationally—how to break processes down into components that can be then fully described—and to develop other habits necessary for a computer scientist. Even if you don’t end up majoring or minoring in Computer Science, this course will count toward your Core requirements for Science and Mathematics, which all students need in order to graduate.

    <p>
        If you have some computer science coursework under your belt from either self study, high school, or another college or university, you may be able to place out of COMP 131. Here’s how:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Score a 4 or higher on the College Board Advanced Placement Computer Science examination.

            This will place you into

                COMP 229

            The department will evaluate your situation individually if you fall into one of the following categories:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Students who are self taught

                    Students who have taken the College Board Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles examination
                </li>
            </ul>
            To request to place out of COMP 131 in this way, please contact the Computer Science Department Chair, Prof. Kathryn Leonard.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In general, to place out of COMP 131, a student should be proficient in variables, branches (if, else), loops (for, while), functions (parameters, scope, return -vs- print), and object-oriented programming (classes vs. instances, constructors, passing familiarity with inheritance).

            transfer credit

To obtain authorization for transfer credit, please submit the following course information by email to Prof. Kathryn Leonard:

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        ​The department will determine if the course is appropriate for COMP credit, and at what level. The registrar will determine how many Oxy units the course will be allocated. Please note that lower-division computer science courses without significant programming are unlikely to be approved for COMP credit, though they may be eligible for Oxy credit.
