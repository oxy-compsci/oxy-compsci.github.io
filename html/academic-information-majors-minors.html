        To complete the Computer Science major, you must take an additional six courses on top of the required core coursework. These six additional courses will vary depending on which of the following three pathways through the major you select.
    </p>
    <h3 id="CS_Pathway">
        Computer Science Pathway
    </h3>
    <p>
        To complete the computer science pathway through the major, your six additional courses must be in Computer Science, and they must meet the following requirements:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            All six courses must be at the 200-level or above in at least two different subfields of computer science. The subfields are artificial intelligence, interfaces, security, systems, and theory.
        </li>
        <li>
            At least three of these courses must be 300-level.

        Students will graduate with broad working knowledge of the many facets of the field, while maintaining freedom to pursue specific topics in depth. Students may count
        <em>
            two courses at most

    <p>
        The proposal must include the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The theme for the concentration, its connection to computer science and technology, and what additional knowledge an interdisciplinary concentration would provide.
        </li>
        <li>
            The list of 6 courses (24 credits) at the 200-level or above, including 2-3 courses in Computer Science and 3-4 courses outside Computer Science, that you will take to complete the major. You should specify which courses you have already completed and estimate when the remaining courses will be offered.
        </li>
        <li>
            A fallback plan for completing the traditional computer science pathway, if the courses for the CS + X concentration are not available or are full.

            About the Senior Comprehensive Project
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
        In your senior year, as part of your graduation requirements, you will complete a project on a topic in computer science. You will work on your project as part of your coursework in the Computer Science Senior Seminar (COMP 490). All majors take COMP 490 in the fall semester of the senior year. If you’re considering studying abroad, you must coordinate with the department to ensure the completion of your senior comprehensive project.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of COMP 490, you will present your completed project to the computer science faculty at a public showcase open to the campus community. In addition to your project, you are also required to complete a written thesis on your work.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are pursuing the CS+X pathway, you must complete a comprehensive project related to your theme.
    </p>

        Earning Distinction on the Comprehensive Project
    </h3>
    <p>
        Distinction will be awarded by the Computer Science faculty (and in consultation with external faculty for students pursuing CS+X) to exceptionally strong comprehensive projects.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Graduating With Honors
    </h3>
    <p>
        Honors in Computer Science may be awarded to graduating seniors who demonstrate excellence in their coursework and earn a grade of “pass with distinction” on their senior comprehensive project. To be eligible, students must have a 3.5 grade point average in the major and a 3.25 overall grade point average.
