            Overview
        </h2>
        <p>
            Computers have transformed our world technologically, economically, and socially. Although computer science has its roots in mathematics, the use of computers increasingly informs almost every academic discipline. At Occidental College, the study of Computer Science emphasizes an understanding not only of the process of computing but also of the promise and limitations of computers within an intellectual, societal, and ethical framework. A major or minor in Computer Science can help prepare students for a variety of opportunities for subsequent employment or graduate work. Moreover, the program can provide students with models of problem solving and theoretical constructs that can shed light on human intelligence and the workings of the mind.

            Major Requirements
        </h2>
        <p>
            Computer science is a broad field, on that encompasses everything from digital logic and advanced mathematical theory, to video games and data science. Simultaneously, these foundations and applications all require fundamental knowledge of how a computer works, as well as the ability to translate processes into working programs.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Computer science major coursework mirrors this structure. A student majoring in Computer Science must take a minimum of 12 courses (48 units) and take or pass out of Calculus I.

        <p>
            Students will graduate with broad working knowledge of the many facets of the field, while maintaining freedom to pursue specific topics in depth.

        <h4 class="sc-RequiredCoursesHeading2">
            CS+X Pathway
        </h4>
        <p>
            Six courses 200-level or above, with at least three at the 300-level. Students must complete two CS courses in different sub-fields, a four-course interdisciplinary concentration around a computer science or technology theme (for a total of 24 units), plus a senior comprehensive project related to the theme.
        </p>
        <p>
            This selection of courses - commonly known as CS+X - reflects the growing importance of computer science in many fields, and allows students to explore the intersection of technology with their other academic interests. Students who are interested in the interdisciplinary concentration option will work with an advisor to propose a concentration of four courses (including at least three outside of computer science) on a related theme. Proposals must include an intellectual rationale for the course selection, and a faculty member outside of Computer Science must approve the proposal and agree to act as an outside advisor for the senior comprehensive project. The proposal should be submitted to the Computer Science Department Chair no later than two semesters prior to the semester of graduation, at least two weeks before Advising Week. If approved, students and the Registrar's Office will be notified prior to the first day of registration. Any changes to the concentration must be done via a Petition for Special Consideration, signed by the academic advisor, the department chair, and by the outside advisor for the concentration, and submitted to the Registrar's Office no later than the week prior to registration in the semester before graduation.

The writing requirement must be completed by May of the student's junior year; students considering study abroad must coordinate with the department early to ensure that they can fulfill the writing requirement. In order to graduate, students who fail to fulfill the writing requirement by the deadline will be required to (1) take a composition course in the Writing &amp; Rhetoric Department, approved by the Computer Science department chair and the Director of Writing Programs; and (2) include and complete a written component in their senior comprehensive that meets the approval of the Computer Science faculty.

Example projects include a fully functional and user-tested mobile app, a research paper in computer science, or a review of technology policies and their impacts. Students who pursue the CS+X pathway must complete a comprehensive project related to their theme. Distinction will be awarded by the Computer Science faculty (and in consultation with external faculty for students pursuing CS+X) to exceptionally strong comprehensive projects.
