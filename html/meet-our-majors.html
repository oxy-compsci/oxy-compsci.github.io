<p>I've been interested in Computer Science since middle school, but I'm still solidifying a specific pathway within the major. Other than enjoying programming, I like knowing why and how computers work, along with the math behind the algorithms and structures that make systems more efficient.</p>

<p>I am a senior computer science and cognitive science double major from Chicago, IL. This past summer, I did the summer research program with my advisor, Professor Justin Li. The research was concerned with studying when episodic and semantic memory are used to recall personal information with greater efficiency. Iâ€™m particularly interested in Artificial Intelligence and machine learning, and I would like to pursue a research project detecting and correcting bias found in text corpora during machine learning.</p>

<p>I am a Computer Science + Politics Major, Interdisciplinary Writing Minor from a small town in Upstate New York. I look forward to exploring the intersections between computer science and politics and those intersections manifest in everyday life. I didn't learn how to code until college, so I look forward to all the challenges I will face and what I will learn by conquering them. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, collaging postcards for loved ones, and spending time with dear friends.</p>

<p>I always had a passion for technology and computers so I was convinced to take COMP 131 my sophomore year. I fell in love with coding and declared computer science as my second major! I'm excited to explore the intersection of my two majors, cognitive science and computer science. I'm especially interested in artificial intelligence and human computer interaction. I'm also a big fan of video games, so this summer I ended up teaching myself how to create video games using the Unity game engine. During the semester, you can find me fixing the school's tech at the ITS Helpdesk.</p>
