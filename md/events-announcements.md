Invention is novelty stacked on history, or as Newton said, "standing on the shoulders of giants." This concept was at the core of the liberal arts education I received at OXY in the late 80's, and though "Game Design" was nowhere to be found in the curriculum, I will argue that a liberal arts education gave me the best preparation I could have had for a successful 20+year career in the field. The talk will describe...

### [Oxy&#8217;s Innovative Computer Science Major Makes Headlines](https://www.oxy.edu/computer-science/events-announcements/oxy-s-innovative-computer-science-major-makes-headlines)

 * #### It took Occidental&#8217;s new computer science major less than a year to make front-page news in the *Los Angeles Times*. Through extensive quotes from faculty and students, [the story](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-occidental-computer-science-20180313-story.html) describes Oxy&#8217;s innovative approach that asks students to explore technology&#8217;s impact on the world and the challenges that come with it.
 ![](https://www.oxy.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news/public/CompSci-Leonard_0.jpg?itok=qnDgCwrN)Launched last fall, the interdisciplinary computer science major is one of a growing number of programs established at liberal arts colleges that look beyond a narrow vocational approach to the field.
Computer science classes at Oxy &#8220;also push [students] to grapple with the inequalities and philosophical dilemmas that technology is creating out in the world,&#8221; the Times reports. The goal is to make students &#8220;consider the real-world implications of what they are doing &#8212; that their code is not just abstract problem-solving but may have positive or negative impacts on real people," Assistant Professor of Cognitive Science Justin Li tells the newspaper.
Oxy&#8217;s approach also is designed to tap talent from a broader range of students, including...
