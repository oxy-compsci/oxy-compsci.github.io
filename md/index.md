Computers have transformed our world technologically, economically, and socially. Although computer science has its roots in mathematics, the use of computers increasingly informs fields as diverse as music and medicine, and is necessary for a complete understanding of national policy and international trade.

At Occidental, the study of Computer Science emphasizes not only the process of computing, but also the promise and limitations of computers within its intellectual, societal, and ethical context. Embracing the liberal arts environment, we strive to provide students with a rigorous technical grounding, while also encouraging them to seek out computational connections to the media arts, to cognitive science, and to the many other disciplines at Occidental.

We also offer additional opportunities with partnering institutions. Occidental and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) share a [unique cooperative program](https://www.oxy.edu/academics/programs-majors/exchange-cooperative-programs) that allows for our students to supplement their study by taking courses at Caltech without additional tuition. Additionally, the [3-2 engineering program](https://www.oxy.edu/physics/3-2-engineering-program) allows students interested in engineering to transfer to Caltech or Columbia University (in New York City) after their third year, to graduate with both a B.S. degree at that institution and a B.A. from Occidental.

If you have any questions about studying computer science at Occidental, contact [Kathryn Leonard](mailto:leonardk@oxy.edu), chair of Computer Science.

## Computer Science Placement

A score of 4 or 5 on the AP Computer Science exam places a student into [COMP 229](http://oxy.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2017-2018/Catalog/Courses/COMP-Computer-Science/200/COMP-229) (Data Structures), earning credit for the completion of [COMP 131](http://oxy.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2017-2018/Catalog/Courses/COMP-Computer-Science/100/COMP-131).

In general, to place out of COMP 131, a student should be proficient in variables, branches (if, else), loops (for, while), functions (parameters, scope, return -vs- print), and object-oriented programming (classes -vs- instances, constructors, passing familiarity with inheritance). For students who have taken the AP Computer Science Principles exam, who have transfer credit, or are in similar situations, we will evaluate your situation individually. All other students should begin with COMP 131 as soon as possible.
